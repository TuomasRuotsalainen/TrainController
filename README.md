# TrainController

The purpose of this project is to fully automate a MÃ¤rklin model train layout, including shunting of trains. It's still in very early stages, and considering available time it will most likely take years. Stay tuned :D

The software consists of two parts
1. An embedded system, that's used to send control commands to physical devices and gather data from the layout. Is built with Arduino. 
2. A high-level control system running on PC. Will also include an UI. Probably will be implemented with Python.
