Railuino is not my work.

This is just a fork of Railuino v0.9. (https://code.google.com/archive/p/railuino/), under license GNU Lesser GPL. We use Railuino to send commands to locomotives over a CAN-bus.

Railuino is included in this repository to ensure, that the critical dependency will always be available.
